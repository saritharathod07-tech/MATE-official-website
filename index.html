    <h2>🌱 Beginning – Friendship</h2>
    <p>
    Arjun, a simple and caring engineering student, falls in love at first sight with Megha on their first day of college.
    But instead of confessing, he becomes her closest friend.
    They spend every day together — sharing tea, sitting on the last bench, walking through campus, laughing at silly jokes.
    Megha calls him her “Mate” — someone more than a friend, but not a lover.
    For Arjun, she slowly becomes his whole world.
    </p>

    <h2>💔 Middle – Love & Heartbreak</h2>
    <p>
    In their second year, Megha falls in love with a senior, Rahul.
    Arjun hides his feelings and supports her, even helping her text Rahul.
    But Rahul only sees Megha as timepass.
    In the third year, Megha discovers the truth and is heartbroken.
    Arjun, unable to tolerate her pain, confronts Rahul.
    For the first time, Megha sees how deeply Arjun cares for her.
    </p>

    <h2>🌤 Realization</h2>
    <p>
    After the breakup, Arjun stays beside her — not as a lover demanding attention, but as the same loyal friend.
    Slowly, Megha begins to notice:
    He never left her.
    He never judged her.
    He always chose her happiness.
    In their final year, during a simple mall outing, she finally understands — the love she was searching for was walking beside her all along.
    </p>

    <h2>❤️ Climax – Love Confession</h2>
    <p>
    In an emotional moment, Megha confesses:
    She says she looked everywhere for love, but her true partner was always her “Mate.”
    Arjun accepts her love — not with anger, not with pride — but with the same calm heart that loved her from the beginning.
    They walk forward together — no drama, no grand promises — just pure understanding.
    </p>

    <h2>🎯 Core Message</h2>
    <p>
    “Sometimes the person who stays silently beside you is the one meant to stay forever.”
    </p>
